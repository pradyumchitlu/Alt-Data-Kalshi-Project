- This is where the ranking updates: [Top 10 Shows on Netflix Right Now](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv)
  - Netflix ranking methodology:
    - Hours viewed determines outcomes
    - Not account count
- Contract resolves at 10:00 AM ET following the weekly Netflix top 10 chart update
  - Typically updates Tuesdays around 10 AM ET
- What if Netflix corrects its chart later
  - Kalshi still settles on the first published version
